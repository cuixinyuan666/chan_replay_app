This file is the project manual for the multi-level and interval-nest work.

## Current review baseline

Latest observed head before this manual: 82a376ee13d0832139bad396224296f0bfc3d86b
Manual placeholder commit: a173ae2cd0f75fdf1b2dcfa5f2c67638546b1574

## User objective

Build chan.py multi-level support and interval-nest workflow into the app.

The app should support multi-level replay, strict step replay, high-level to low-level mapping, interval-nest signals, training, statistics, scanning, scoring, trade-plan output, timeline, and reports.

## Review rule

All future checks use the latest push on origin_vespa_tdx.

## Current accepted work

- Multi-level models exist.
- Multi-level parser and source exist.
- Independent MultiLevelReplayPage exists.
- RootPage has a multi-level entry.
- Bridge analyze_multi exists as fallback.
- Native CChan lv_list engine exists.
- analyze_multi is native-first with bridge fallback.

## Current blockers

- Native runtime result is not verified yet.
- Native step frames are not implemented yet.
- Interval-nest rule engine is not implemented yet.

## Questions for task party

1. Does analyze_multi return native_cchan_lv_list true?
2. Does analyze_multi return level_relation_mode chan_parent_child?
3. Is fallback_to_bridge absent or false?
4. What is relations.length?
5. Does step mode return frames?
